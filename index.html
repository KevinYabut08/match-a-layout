      The Great Wave off Kanagawa (Japanese: 神奈川沖浪裏, Hepburn: Kanagawa-oki
      Nami Ura, lit. 'Under the Wave off Kanagawa')[a] is a woodblock print by
      Japanese ukiyo-e artist Hokusai, created in late 1831 during the Edo
      period of Japanese history. The print depicts three boats moving through a
      storm-tossed sea, with a large, cresting wave forming a spiral in the
      centre and Mount Fuji visible in the background. The print is Hokusai's
      best-known work and the first in his series Thirty-six Views of Mount
      Fuji, in which the use of Prussian blue revolutionized Japanese prints.
      The composition of The Great Wave is a synthesis of traditional Japanese
      prints and use of graphical perspective developed in Europe, and earned
      him immediate success in Japan and later in Europe, where Hokusai's art
      inspired works by the Impressionists. Several museums throughout the world
      hold copies of The Great Wave, many of which came from 19th-century
      private collections of Japanese prints. The Great Wave off Kanagawa has
      been described as "possibly the most reproduced image in the history of
      all art",[1] as well as being a contender for the "most famous artwork in
      Japanese history".[2] This woodblock print has influenced several notable
      artists and musicians, including Vincent van Gogh, Claude Debussy, Claude
      Monet, and Utagawa Hiroshige.
